# OpenCV
 OpenCV is an open-source library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.
 
 Here, I am using Haarcascade which is an classifier which is trained to classify different objects and faces.
 1. haarcascade_frontalface_default --> It is trained to classify and detect faces in video/images
 2. haarcascade_eye --> It is trained to classify and detect eyes.
 
 OpenCV alone isn't capable for best results but it also depends upon the camera/instrument You use for implementing this project.
 
It is recommended/mandatory to explicitly install OpenCV on your machine by executing below line in command prompt/Terminal:
pip install opencv-python
